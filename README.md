Tested for Minecraft versions: 1.20.5, 1.21.x

Current features:
- Permission feature - optional
- Leashed-Invulnerable feature - allows the entity that is leashed to be immune to damage - optional
- Anti-Break feature - prevents lead from breaking before the length gets to 10 blocks, teleports the leashed entity to the leash-holder once the distance is greater than 7.5 blocks (to account for walking/running speeds)
